# ESN

This model is a replication of the Working Memory (WM) model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) of the Echo State Network (ESN) type used by Razvan Pascanu and Herbert Jaeger in ["A Neurodynamical Model for Working Memory"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608010001899) for [The ReScience Journal](http://rescience.github.io/).

This model is based from the article, and was built from scratch in Python3 to be as close as possible as the one described in the paper.

## Description of the model

This model is described in further details in [ReScience replication](LINK)).

## How to use it

In order to launch the training and testing sequence in classic mode (4 fonts, random seed), use the following command:

```bash
    python3 ESN.py
    ```
