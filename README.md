# JaegerESN

This model is a replication of the Working Memory (WM) model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) of the Echo State Network (ESN) type used by Razvan Pascanu and Herbert Jaeger in ["A Neurodynamical Model for Working Memory"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608010001899).

This model is based from the article, and was built from scratch in Python3 to be as close as possible as the one described in the paper.
